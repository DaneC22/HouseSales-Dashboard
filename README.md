# HouseSales-Dashboard
Data Visualization for House Sales

Hi! I'm Dane Condes — an aspiring Supply Chain Analyst. I'm currently learning more about Tableau, SQL, and supply chain analytics.  
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyria-dane-condes/).

This is my second published data visualization project. It explores trends and key factors influencing house sale prices. Built using Tableau, this interactive dashboard provides valuable insights for real estate professionals, analysts, and data enthusiasts.

-  **Price distribution** across different house conditions
-  **Relationship between square footage and price**
-  **Sales patterns** by year and month
